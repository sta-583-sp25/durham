# Introduction

Durham has historically been a major center of the American tobacco and textile industries. In recent years, Durham has experienced explosive population growth due to its position as an anchor of the Research Triangle Park and the high-tech industries it supports. Additionally, Durham is one of the largest cities in North Carolina and enjoys a diverse urban landscape within its borders; for instance, ZIP code 27701 comprises a densely populated urban core which contains downtown Durham and its immediate environs, while ZIP code 27712 in northern Durham County is semi-rural and contains large swaths of preserved natural parkland, golf courses, and farms.

Since 2005, Durham has solicited a third-party to conduct a regular survey among residents to help advise the cityâ€™s strategic growth plan. The purpose of the survey is to assist city administrators and planners in making decisions about prioritizing areas of the city to focus on and to identify potential areas for improvement. The survey contains a variety of questions regarding resident perception of life in Durham, as well as demographic factors and geographic data.
Project objectives

The data to use are from the 2022 edition of the Durham City/County Resident Survey, an annual survey administered by the ETC Institute [here](https://live-durhamnc.opendata.arcgis.com/documents/2459a4fcb09345b1a6135321bf91eac9/about).

# Project objectives

The overall objectives are the following:

- Evaluate whether perceived satisfaction with quality of life is associated with the length of time residents have lived in Durham.
- As a secondary goal, Durham city administrators are interested in whether any potential relationships depend on whether city residents own or rent their primary residence. It is possible that due to location or neighborhood-specific factors, residents may exhibit some degree of non-independence from other residents due to geographic factors. This possibility should be addressed in your analysis.
